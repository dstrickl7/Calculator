## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Javascript


### What I learned

I learned how to break projects down into smaller portions to make them easier to manage. I cemented my basic understanding of Javascript DOM manipulation and using the console for troubleshooting.


### Challenges
Since this was my very first project, I had many challenges and struggles. Learning how to break down the project was my biggest hurdle. Once I broke down the project into smaller pieces, my progression was much quicker. The next biggest challenge I had was figuring out how to display my numbers. Looking back, I'm a little embarrassed that I struggled with this. My next challenge was the keyboard functionality. I wanted to be able to use efficient code to do it, but I couldn't seem to make it work and ended up using a brute force method.


### Continued development

I really dislike how inefficient my code is, especially for the keyboard functionality. I hope to learn better ways to accomplish these tasks. I also have 3 issues I plan to fix:

- If two different operators are selected, only the first operator is registered. Need to return the last operator
- If evaluated, hitting an operation does not continue the operation.
- If large number is returned, value breaks out of it's container

### Acknowledgements
- WEBCIFAR [Build A Simple Calculator With JavaScript | Mini Project For Beginners] (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdxaLo9ALJgXgOUDURRPGiQ) - I viewed part of their video to figure out how to display my values. I also liked the history display they used and decided to incorporate my own version of it in my project.
